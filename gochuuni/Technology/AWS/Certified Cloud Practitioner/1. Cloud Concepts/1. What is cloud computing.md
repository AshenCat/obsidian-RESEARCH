# What is Cloud Computing?
the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

- ! You hire the IT people
- ! You pay or rent the real-estate
- ! You take all the risk

Cloud Providers
- $ Someone else owns the servers
- $ Someone else hires the IT people
- $ Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
- $ You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone takes care of the rest
