# Why go with a Cloud Provider over On-Premise
## 1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
**No upfront-cost** instead of paying for data centers and servers **Pay On-Demand** Pay only when you consume computing resources

## 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud.
You are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings.

## 3. Stop guessing capacity
Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.

## 4. Increase speed and agility
Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise

## 5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers

## 6. Go global in minutes
Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.
Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
