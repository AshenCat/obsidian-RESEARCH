**Q5: What best describes the “Principle of Least Privilege”? Choose the correct answer from the options given below.**

**A.** All users should have the same baseline permissions granted to them to use basic AWS services. 

**B.** Users should be granted permission to access only resources they need to do their assigned job.  
**C.** Users should submit all access requests in written form so that there is a paper trail of who needs access to different AWS resources.  

**D.** Users should always have a little more permission than they need.

### Answer
**Answer – B**

**Explanation :** 

The principle means giving a user account only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function.

**Q7: Which of the following is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the availability and backup of the EBS volumes?**

**A.** Delete the data and create a new EBS volume.  
**B.** Create EBS snapshots.  
**C.** Attach new volumes to EC2 Instances.  
**D.** Create copies of EBS Volumes.

### Answer
**Answer – B**

**Explanation :** 

Snapshots are _incremental_ backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. 

When you create an EBS volume based on a snapshot, the new volume begins as an exact replica of the original volume that was used to create the snapshot. The replicated volume loads data in the background so that you can begin using it immediately.

Amazon EBS snapshots | Source: aws.amazon.com

**Option A is incorrect** because there is no need for backup of the volumes if data is already deleted.

**Option C is incorrect** because attaching more EBS volumes doesn’t ensure availability, if there is no snapshot then the volume cannot be available to a different availability zone.

**Option D is incorrect** EBS volumes cannot be copied, they can only be replicated using snapshots.

For more information on EBS Snapshots, please refer to the below URL:[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html)

### Answer
**Answer – A**

**Explanation :** 

Amazon CloudFront supports country-level location-based web content personalization with a feature called Geolocation Headers.

You can configure CloudFront to add additional geolocation headers that provide more granularity in your caching and origin request policies. The new headers give you more granular control of cache behavior and your origin access to the viewer’s country name, region, city, postal code, latitude, and longitude, all based on the viewer’s IP address.

![CloudFront Distribution](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cc16.webp "Amazon CloudFront with Geolocation Headers")

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because EC2 is just a distractor, not suitable for routing and delivery.
- **Option C is INCORRECT** because Amazon Lightsail will primarily allow for developing, deploying, and hosting websites and web applications. The service will not meet the requirements of the scenario.

**Q19: A company wants to utilize AWS storage. For them, low storage cost is paramount. The data is rarely retrieved and a data retrieval time of 13-14 hours is acceptable for them. What is the best storage option to use?**

**A.** Amazon S3 Glacier  
**B.** S3 Glacier Deep Archive  
**C.** Amazon EBS volumes  
**D.** AWS CloudFront

### Answer
**Answer – B**

**Explanation :** 

**S3 Glacier Deep Archive** offers the lowest cost storage in the cloud, at prices lower than storing and maintaining data in on-premises magnetic tape libraries or archiving data offsite.

It expands our data archiving offerings, enabling you to select the optimal storage class based on storage and retrieval costs, and retrieval times.

**Option B is correct** because S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers low-cost storage and retrieval time doesn’t matter for the company. If the question asks for fast retrieval time then S3 Glacier would be correct.

**Option A is incorrect** because S3 Glacier is not cheaper than S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

**Options C and D are incorrect** because they are not suitable for data archive and faster retrieval. Also, the CloudFront is not for storage.

With **S3 Glacie**r, customers can store their data cost-effectively for months, years, or even decades. S3 Glacier enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don’t have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection, and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.

- **Amazon S3 Glacier** for archiving data that might infrequently need to be restored within a few hours
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** for archiving long-term backup cycle data that might infrequently need to be restored within 12 hours

**Q31: I have a huge amount of data (images, documents). I want to store them on AWS storage service S3 and know how S3 is priced to make informed decisions. Which of the following is accounted as a cost for S3 storage? Select TWO.** 

**A.** While uploading data to an S3 bucket 

**B.** Lifecycle transition requests 

**C.** Outbound data transfer from S3 in US-West to an EC2 instance in US-West 

**D.** Outbound data transfer to Amazon CloudFront 

**E.** Outbound data transfer from S3 in US-East to an EC2 instance in US-West 

### Answer
**Correct Answers: B and E** 

**Explanation:** 

**Option A is incorrect.** Data transferred in from the internet to S3 does not incur any charges. 

**Option B is CORRECT.** Lifecycle data transfers between the storage classes can be considered as GET/PUT operations from the source storage class to the target storage class which will incur cost. 

**Option C is incorrect.** Outbound data transfers from S3 within the same Region (including a different AWS account) do not incur any charges. 

**Option D is incorrect.** Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront performed as a request by CloudFront to the Origin server (S3) for caching content does not incur any charges. 

**Option E is CORRECT** since the Outbound data transfer is done out of the region where the S3 bucket resides.

**Q32: I am using the Amazon Simple Notification Service to send notifications to alert admins whenever the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance crosses 70%. Which of the following can be subscribers to an SNS Topic? (Select TWO)** 

**A.** Email 

**B.** Amazon S3 

**C.** AWS Lambda 

**D.** Amazon CloudWatch 

**E.** Amazon DynamoDB streams 

### Answer
**Correct Answers: A and C** 

**Explanation:** 

SNS is extremely useful for the fan-out types of applications, i.e., multiple clients that push messages to an SNS topic & multiple listeners can be notified when a message arrives at the Topic. 

**Option A is CORRECT.** SNS messages can be sent to registered addresses as Email (text-based or Object) who act as subscribers to the notification 

**Option B is incorrect.** S3 acts as a publisher of SNS notifications. When a file is uploaded to S3, it can publish an event that can then be subscribed to & acted upon 

**Option C is CORRECT.** A lambda function can subscribe to an SNS Topic and can act on any events that are published to that Topic. An S3 PUT or CREATE event for uploading documents can have a Lambda subscriber that can pull out metadata information contained within the documents & store it in a Dynamo DB database. 

**Option D is incorrect.** CloudWatch will act as a publisher of events using alarms. Getting back to our scenario, we can set CloudWatch alarms on the CPU utilization metrics of the EC2 instance. The alarms can then be published to an SNS Topic for notifying users. 

**Option E is incorrect.** Dynamo DB streams are events that are emitted when record modifications occur on a Dynamo DB table like INSERT, UPDATE, etc. They are extremely useful to create informative dashboards in real-time. Dynamo DB streams can trigger a lambda function that can publish a message to an SNS Topic. So we can see here that Dynamo DB stream acts as a publisher of events.

**Q 33: I require different levels of access for my application that is installed on an EC2 instance. I have configured an ENI for the same purpose. Which of the following statement is incorrect?** 

A. I can detach the primary ENI of my EC2 instance and connect it to another instance for moving its Elastic IP 

B. I can configure a Security Group for my ENI and restrict traffic to the EC2 instance 

C. I can detach a secondary ENI containing a Private IP from one EC2 instance and attach it to another 

D. I can attach an Elastic IP to an EC2 instance in another subnet by releasing it from the ENI in the current subnet to which it is currently attached to 

**Correct Answer:** **A** 

**Explanation:** 

**Option A is CORRECT.** The primary ENI of an instance cannot be detached from the instance. By default, the primary ENI is created with the creation of the EC2 instance & deleted when the instance is terminated 

**Option B is incorrect** since an EC2 instance may require restricted access to certain IP addresses. This can be achieved by creating a new ENI & attaching a Public IP & Security Group restricting permissions. 

**Option C is incorrect.** Secondary ENI’s that are created can be detached from the instance to which it is attached to & attached to another instance within the same subnet. The Private IP then gets allocated to the second instance to which it is attached currently 

**Option D is incorrect.** ENI’s are subnet specific. So for attaching an Elastic IP to an instance in a different subnet, I need to first release it to the pool by dissociating it from an attached instance. This way, I can attach the Elastic IP to an instance in a different subnet.

**Q 34: Which of the following statements accurately describe a function of AWS Secrets Manager? [Select Two]** 

A. Encrypts authentication information in code, ensuring that it is unreadable, that is, not in plain-text. 

B. Replaces the need to hardcode authentication credentials in code. 

C. Makes it possible to include an API call in code that retrieves authentication information from a central repository. 

D. Automatically rotates and updates the code in the application build, ensuring that repositories are kept up to date. 

E. Facilitates the embedding of authentication information in code during runtime. 

### Answer
**Correct Answer: B and C** 

**Explanation:** 

AWS Secrets Manager allows users to replace authentication information in code with an API call to Secrets Manager. This API call then retrieves the secret programmatically. This safeguards the secret from being compromised since the secret is removed from the code. AWS Secrets Manager automatically rotates the secret in accordance with specified schedules which allows the implementation of more secure short-term secrets. These, in turn, reduce the risk of authentication information in code being compromised. 

**Option A is INCORRECT** because AWS Secrets Manager does not encrypt authentication information whilst it is in the code. 

**Option D is INCORRECT** because AWS Secrets Manager does not automatically rotate or update the application code. Rather, it automatically rotates the secret in accordance with specified schedules. 

**Option E is INCORRECT** because AWS Secrets Manager does not facilitate embedding authentication information in code during runtime. Developers do not need to hard-code authentication information in code.
