An _Auto Scaling group_ contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also lets you use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.

The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.

An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it. For more information, see [Health checks for Auto Scaling instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html).

You can use scaling policies to increase or decrease the number of instances in your group dynamically to meet changing conditions. When the scaling policy is in effect, the Auto Scaling group adjusts the desired capacity of the group, between the minimum and maximum capacity values that you specify, and launches or terminates the instances as needed. You can also scale on a schedule. For more information, see [Scale the size of your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/scale-your-group.html).

An Auto Scaling group can launch On-Demand Instances, Spot Instances, or both. You can specify multiple purchase options for your Auto Scaling group only when you use a launch template.

Spot Instances provide you with access to unused EC2 capacity at steep discounts relative to On-Demand prices. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/). There are key differences between Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances:
- The price for Spot Instances varies based on demand
- Amazon EC2 can terminate an individual Spot Instance as the availability of, or price for, Spot Instances changes

When a Spot Instance is terminated, the Auto Scaling group attempts to launch a replacement instance to maintain the desired capacity for the group.

When instances are launched, if you specified multiple Availability Zones, the desired capacity is distributed across these Availability Zones. If a scaling action occurs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically maintains balance across all of the Availability Zones that you specify.
# What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called _Auto Scaling groups_. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size. If you specify the desired capacity, either when you create the group or at any time thereafter, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group has this many instances. If you specify scaling policies, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases.

For example, the following Auto Scaling group has a minimum size of one instance, a desired capacity of two instances, and a maximum size of four instances. The scaling policies that you define adjust the number of instances, within your minimum and maximum number of instances, based on the criteria that you specify.

## Auto Scaling components

The following table describes the key components of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![A graphic representing an Auto Scaling group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/group-graphic.png)|Groups<br><br>Your EC2 instances are organized into _groups_ so that they can be treated as a logical unit for the purposes of scaling and management. When you create a group, you can specify its minimum, maximum, and, desired number of EC2 instances. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html).|
|![A graphic representing a launch template or launch<br>configuration.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/launch-configuration-graphic.png)|Configuration templates<br><br>Your group uses a _launch template_, or a _launch configuration_ (not recommended, offers fewer features), as a configuration template for its EC2 instances. You can specify information such as the AMI ID, instance type, key pair, security groups, and block device mapping for your instances. For more information, see [Launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html) and [Launch configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-configurations.html).|
|![A graphic representing scaling options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/scaling-plan-graphic.png)|Scaling options<br><br>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provides several ways for you to scale your Auto Scaling groups. For example, you can configure a group to scale based on the occurrence of specified conditions (dynamic scaling) or on a schedule. For more information, see [Scaling options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/scale-your-group.html#scaling-options).|
