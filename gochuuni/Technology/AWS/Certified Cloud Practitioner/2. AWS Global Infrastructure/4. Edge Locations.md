> Get data fast or upload data fast to AWS

an Edge location is a datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a direct connection to the AWS network

These locations serve request for CloudFront and Route53. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically

S3 Transfer Acceleration traffic and API Gateway endpoint traffic also use the AWS Edge Network

This allows for low latency no matter where the end user is geographically located
