When you launch an EC2 instance, it is bydefault using On-Demand pricing
On-demand has no up-front payment and no long-term commitment

You are charged by the hour or by the minute(varies based on EC2 Instance Types)

On-Demand is for applications where the workload is for short-term, spikey or unpredictable.
