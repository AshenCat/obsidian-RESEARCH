| | Automated | Manual |
| -------- | -------- | --------|
| Processing time | Exponentially faster | Consumes human resources and is time consuming |
| Exploratory | Does not allow; What you code is what is tested | Allows exploratory and random testing |
| Initial Investment | Bigger upfront cost but better return of investment for the long term | Significantly smaller upfront but very low return of investment |
| Reliability | Very robust and reliable | Prone to encounter human errors |
| Adaptability to change | Needs to be rewritten when there's a change | Comparatively simple and quicker to adapt |
| Resources | calls for testing tools and automation engineers | calls for investing in human resources |
| Value for money | will work out if the test content volume is large | will not be cost effective for high volume testing |
| Performance testing | allows tests like load testing, stress testing | does not offer feasibility when performance testing is a main point of concern |
| Programming knowledge | a must | not required |
| DevOps | helps in build verification and testing which are integral to the DevOps Cycle | defeats the automated build principle of DevOps entirely and lowers efficiency |
