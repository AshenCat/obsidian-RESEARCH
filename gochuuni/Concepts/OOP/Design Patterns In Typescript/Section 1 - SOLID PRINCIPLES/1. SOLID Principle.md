# Single Responsibility
A class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality

# Open/Closed
Open to extension, Closed to Modification

# Liskov Substitution
Also known as substitutability

You should be able to use a subclass in place of its parent class

# Interface segregation
A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement

# Dependency Inversion
Your classes and modules should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations
