# Tell me about yourself.
> I am a software developer with two years of experience working with React and NodeJS. During that time, I have integrated the company with ATS partner companies such as Lever and Greenhouse. In my spare time, I like to hang out with my friends online. If they are unavailable, I try to tinker with electronics or learn new web technologies.

# How would you describe yourself?
> I am a critical thinker and a team player. I've had supervised student interns where I provide them technical support and troubleshooting assistance to guide them to finish their task. Additionally, I've also collaborated with partner companies to integrate our systems together. 

# What makes you unique?
> My experience integrating with companies is what makes me unique from others.
